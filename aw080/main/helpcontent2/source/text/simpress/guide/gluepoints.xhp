When you draw a connector between shapes, the connector will be attached to a gluepoint on each shape. Each shape has some default gluepoints, and the positions of the default gluepoints depend on the specific shape. You can add your own custom gluepoints to a shape and then attach connectors to the custom gluepoints.</paragraph>
