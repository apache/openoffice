<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3153193" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="9">
<emph>hour:</emph> Any integer expression that indicates the hour of the time that is used to determine the serial time value. Valid values: 0-23.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3159252" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="10">
<emph>minute:</emph> Any integer expression that indicates the minute of the time that is used to determine the serial time value. In general, use values between 0 and 59. However, you can also use values that lie outside of this range, where the number of minutes influence the hour value.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3161831" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="11">
<emph>second:</emph> Any integer expression that indicates the second of the time that is used to determine the serial time value. In general, you can use values between 0 and 59. However, you can also use values that lie outside of this range, where the number seconds influences the minute value.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3155854" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="12">
<emph>Examples:</emph>
</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3153952" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="13">12, -5, 45 corresponds to 11, 55, 45</paragraph>

<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3147426" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="15">12, 20, -2 corresponds to 12, 19, 58</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3153365" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="16">12, 20, 63 corresponds to 12, 21, 4</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3146985" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="17">You can use the TimeSerial function to convert any time into a single value that you can use to calculate time differences.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3155308" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="18">The TimeSerial function returns the type Variant with VarType 7 (Date). This value is stored internally as a double-precision number between 0 and 0.9999999999. As opposed to the DateSerial or DateValue function, where the serial date values are calculated as days relative to a fixed date, you can calculate with values returned by the TimeSerial function, but you cannot evaluate them.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3149482" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="19">In the TimeValue function, you can pass a string as a parameter containing the time. For the TimeSerial function, however, you can pass the individual parameters (hour, minute, second) as separate numeric expressions.</paragraph>
