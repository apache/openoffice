<paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id3149806" role="paragraph" l10n="CHG">A master document lets you manage large documents, such as a book with many chapters. The master document can be seen as a container for individual <item type="productname">%PRODUCTNAME</item> Writer files. The individual files are called subdocuments.</paragraph>

      <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id3155180" role="note" l10n="C">When you add a document to a master document or create a new subdocument, a link is created in the master document. You cannot edit the content of a subdocument directly in the master document, but you can use the Navigator to open any subdocument for edit.</paragraph>
      <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="hd_id7904904" role="heading" level="2" l10n="NEW">Example of Using Styles</paragraph>
      <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id5817743" role="paragraph" l10n="NEW">A master document master.odm consists of some text and links to the subdocuments sub1.odt and sub2.odt. In each subdocument a new paragraph style with the same name Style1 is defined and used, and the subdocuments are saved.</paragraph>
      <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id9169591" role="paragraph" l10n="NEW">When you save the master document, the styles from the subdocuments are imported into the master document. First, the new style Style1 from the sub1.odt is imported. Next, the new styles from sub2.odt will be imported, but as Style1 now already is present in the master document, this style from sub2.odt will not be imported. </paragraph>
      <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id1590014" role="paragraph" l10n="NEW">In the master document you now see the new style Style1 from the first subdocument. All Style1 paragraphs in the master document will be shown using the Style1 attributes from the first subdocument. However, the second subdocument by itself will not be changed. You see the Style1 paragraphs from the second subdocument with different attributes, depending whether you open the sub2.odt document by itself or as part of the master document.</paragraph>
      <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id5878780" role="tip" l10n="NEW">To avoid confusion, use the same document template for the master document and its subdocuments. This happens automatically when you create the master document and its subdocuments from an existing document with headings, using the command <emph>File - Send - Create Master Document</emph>.</paragraph>
