</section>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3146120" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="3">$[officename] Basic provides tools to help you structuring your projects. It supports various "units" which enable you to group individual SUBS and FUNCTIONS in a Basic project.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="heading" id="hd_id3148575" xml-lang="en-US" level="2" l10n="U" oldref="5">Libraries</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3150011" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="6">Libraries serve as a tool for organizing modules, and can either be attached to a document or a template. When the document or a template is saved, all modules contained in the library are automatically saved as well.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3151112" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="7">A library can contain up to 16,000 modules.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="heading" id="hd_id3149262" xml-lang="en-US" level="2" l10n="U" oldref="8">Modules</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3156441" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="9">A module contains SUBS and FUNCTIONS along with variable declarations. The length of the program that can be saved in a module is limited to 64 KB. If more space is required you can divide a $[officename] Basic project among several modules, and then save them in a single library.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="heading" id="hd_id3152577" xml-lang="en-US" level="2" l10n="U" oldref="11">Dialog Modules</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3149377" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="U" oldref="12">Dialog modules contain dialog definitions, including the dialog box properties, the properties of each dialog element and the events assigned. Since a dialog module can only contain a single dialog, they are often referred to as "dialogs".</paragraph>
