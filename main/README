Building Apache OpenOffice
==========================

    Apache OpenOffice is a big project and depends on several other external libraries.
    The list of prerequisites varies for the different platforms.

    A comprehensive and complete building guide can be found in the project wiki under

    https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/Building_Guide_AOO

    With having all prerequisites in place you can simply run

    cd aoo/main
    autoconf
    ./configure <configure_switches>
    ./bootstrap
    source *.Set.sh
    cd instsetoo_native
    build --all

    Note that building OpenOffice can take several hours.

    The default build will produce a setup version (e.g. setup program on Windows, dmg on macOS,
    rpm and deb packages on Linux) and an archived version. The output can be found in the
    <output> directory in instsetoo_native/<output_dir>/Apache_OpenOffice/...
