<paragraph id="par_id080520100210452" role="paragraph" xml-lang="en-US">Many elements inside a help document carry an id so that they can be identified in other production steps, mainly for localization purposes. The IDs must be unique within a help document and should even be unique across help documents to allow for moving content across help files (which currently is not officially supported without re-translation).</paragraph>
<paragraph id="par_id0805201002104581" role="paragraph" xml-lang="en-US">The help authoring environment takes care of assigning IDs to the corresponding elements on creation, or on <link href="org.openoffice.helpauthoring/ha-validating.xhp">validating</link> the help file (which also happens when a help file is saved).</paragraph>
<paragraph id="par_id0805201002104578" role="note" xml-lang="en-US">If you copy an element within a help file you must make sure that the assigned id is different from the original. Therefore, it is best to copy a paragraph without its leading ID.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="par_id0805201002104546" role="paragraph" xml-lang="en-US">By default, paragraph IDs are not visible. You can show them by hovering the mouse cursor over the front of a paragraph. The ID will be displayed in a popup window. Also, <link href="org.openoffice.helpauthoring/ha-l10n.xhp">toggeling the localization status of a paragraph</link> makes its ID visible:</paragraph>
