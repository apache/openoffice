This is an important step since it determines the appearance of the relative URLs for links and embedded content in the help files. Select the folder that is the last in the path that should not appear in the URLs. For example, for core help files this would be "...helpcontent2/source/".</ahelp></paragraph>

<paragraph id="par_id080420100449499" role="paragraph" xml-lang="en-US">The document root entry is required to correctly compute relative URLs for images, links and transcluded (embedded) content. Make sure that you always have your document root set correctly, before working on a help file (unless you know what you are doing).</paragraph>
<paragraph id="par_id0804201004494922" role="paragraph" xml-lang="en-US">When working on core help files, i.e. the ones inside the helpcontent2 module, the document root must be set to the <emph>helpcontent2/source</emph> directory. For example, <item type="literal">/cws/so-cwsserv01/hcshared99/DEV300/ooo.m99/helpcontent2/source</item>.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="par_id0804201004494943" role="paragraph" xml-lang="en-US">When working on extension help files, the document root must be set to the help/en-US directory that contains the directory named after the extension identifier. For example, <item type="literal">/cws/so-cwsserv01/anextension/DEV300/sun.m99/weird_ext/help/en-US</item>.</paragraph>
