      <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id0112200902353542" role="paragraph" l10n="NEW">Previously, macros have been allowed to reside only in the text sub-documents of forms and reports. Now macros can also be stored in the Base file itself. This means that macros in Base files can be called now from any of its sub-components: forms, reports, table design, query design, relation design, table data view.</paragraph>
      <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id0112200903075865" role="paragraph" l10n="NEW">However, it is technically not possible to store macros both in a Base file and in its sub-documents at the same time. So, if you want to attach some new macros to the Base file, while retaining any existing old macros that were stored in the sub-documents, you must move the existing old macros up to the Base file's macro storage area. </paragraph>
      <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id0112200903075830" role="paragraph" l10n="NEW">The Database Document Macro Migration Wizard can move the macros up into the Base file's storage area. You can then examine the macros and edit them as needed. </paragraph>
      <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id0112200903075951" role="paragraph" l10n="NEW">For example, it is possible that macros from the sub-documents had the same module names and macro names. After you moved the macros into one common macro storage area, you must edit the macros to make the names unique. The wizard cannot do this.</paragraph>
      <paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id0112200903075915" role="paragraph" l10n="NEW">The wizard can backup the Base file to another folder of your choice. The wizard changes the original Base file. The backup remains unchanged.</paragraph>
