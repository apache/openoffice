Layers allow you to assemble elements on a page that are related. Think of layers as individual workspaces that you can hide from view, hide from printing, or lock.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id7036957" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="NEW">Layers do not determine the stacking order of objects on your page, except for the <emph>Controls</emph> layer which is always in front of other layers.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id1614734" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="NEW">The stacking order of objects on your page is determined by the sequence in which you add the objects. You can rearrange the stacking order by <item type="menuitem">Modify - Arrange</item>.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id398876" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="NEW">The areas on a layer that do not contain objects are transparent.</paragraph>

<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3150534" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="CHG" oldref="17">The <emph>Layout</emph> layer is the default workspace. The <emph>Layout</emph> layer determines the location of title, text, and object placeholders on your page.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3150742" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="CHG" oldref="18">The <emph>Controls</emph> layer can be used for buttons that have been assigned an action, but that should not be printed. Set the layer's properties to not printable. Objects on the <emph>Controls</emph> layer are always in front of objects on other layers.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="paragraph" id="par_id3153085" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="CHG" oldref="19">The <emph>Dimension Lines</emph> layer is where you draw, for example, the dimension lines. By switching the layer to show or hide, you can easily switch these lines on and off.</paragraph>
<paragraph role="tip" id="par_id3154507" xml-lang="en-US" l10n="CHG" oldref="2">You can lock a layer to protect its contents, or hide a layer and its contents from view or from printing. When you add a new layer to a page, the layer is added to all of the pages in your document. However, when you add an object to a layer, it is only added to the current page. If you want the object to appear on all of the pages, add the object to the master page (<item type="menuitem">View - Master</item>).</paragraph>
