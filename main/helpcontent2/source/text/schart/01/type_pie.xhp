In the created chart, you can click and drag any sector to separate that sector from the remaining pie or to join it back.</paragraph>
<paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id9121982" role="paragraph" l10n="NEW">Exploded pie - this subtype shows the sectors already separated from each other. In the created chart, you can click and drag any sector to move it along a radial from the pie's center.</paragraph>
<paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id3808404" role="paragraph" l10n="NEW">Donut - this subtype can show multiple data columns. Each data column is shown as one donut shape with a hole inside, where the next data column can be shown. In the created chart, you can click and drag an outer sector to move it along a radial from the donut's center.</paragraph>
