<paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id9384746" role="tip" l10n="NEW">To remove a filter, so that you see all cells again, click inside the area where the filter was applied, then choose <item type="menuitem">Data - Filter - Remove Filter</item>.</paragraph>
<paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_idN10663" role="note" l10n="NEW">When you select multiple rows from an area where a filter was applied, then this selection can include rows that are visible and rows that are hidden by the filter. If you then apply formatting, or delete the selected rows, this action then applies only to the visible rows. The hidden rows are not affected.</paragraph>
<paragraph xml-lang="en-US" id="par_id218817" role="note" l10n="NEW">This is the opposite to rows that you have hidden manually by the <emph>Format - Rows - Hide Rows</emph> command. Manually hidden rows are deleted when you delete a selection that contains them.</paragraph>
