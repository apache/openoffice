/* #i54546# The code belonging to this resource file is sample code for the
 * legacy AddIn interface. The interface is still supported, but deprecated.
 * The strings here were displayed in the function wizard. To prevent
 * duplicated and useless translation effort (functions and strings are also
 * part of the new scaddin module), the strings here are now laid out as fixed
 * untranslatable strings. The entire mechanism with the ../util/cl2c.pl perl
 * script merging the raw .cl and the .src during build time didn't work
 * anymore anyway, since we switched from MS-LCIDs / telephone area codes to
 * ISO codes for resources, and introduced localize.sdf files. Returned was
 * always an empty string. Now at least the fixed English string is returned.
